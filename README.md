CS300/500 - Final Project 

2D Matrix (Yahni Jemison) -

Tensor3D (Elizabeth Okunbor) - I created the Tensor3D class for this project. I built the data structure, wrote all the main functions, and made sure the tensor could store values, add and multiply with other tensors, reshape, and return slices.

2D Matrix and Tensor 3D Test Cases (Cheyenne Prevost) -
